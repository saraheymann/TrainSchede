# TrainSchede

## An app to help you figure out when your next train is.

### The app starts out with a blank table, and form to input the name of the train, destination, time of the first train, and how frequent the train comes.

### The app then analyzes your inputs, places the information in the table, and tells you when your next train is coming.
